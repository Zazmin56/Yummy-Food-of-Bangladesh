            <h1><u> Bangladeshi Main Dishes </u></h1>
            <h2><u> Kachchi Biryani - Special Bangladeshi Food </u></h2>
            <p>Kachchi biryani is usually a featured dish for weddings and social gatherings and celebrations.
                 Layers of meat, rice, and potatoes are infused with warm and delectable blends of aromatic 
                 spices to prepare Kachchi biryani. The term "Kachchi" means raw referring to the biryani 
                 ingredients being combined raw in layers instead of first cooking the meat or rice separately.
                  Traditionally, Kachchi biryani is cooked in a clay oven and the cooking pot is usually sealed
                   with flour dough to allow the biryani to cook in its own steam. The sealed pot is not 
                   opened until the biryani is ready to be served. A simple salad is sufficient as a side 
                   for Kachchi biryani but traditionally Shami Kabab and chutney are served alongside. 
                   Also very popular is to have Borhani with Kachchi biryani, which is a traditional yogurt 
                   drink. Kachchi Biryani is the most popular formal Bangladeshi food that you must try at 
                   least once while visiting Bangladesh.</p>

            <h1> <u>Bangladeshi Evening Snacks </u> </h1>
            <h2><u>Grilled Chicken with Naan Roti </u></h2>
            <p>Grilled Chicken has become very popular in Bangladesh recently. You can find mouth- watering 
                grilled chicken on almost every street. Chicken is marinated with spices and later grilled 
                on the griller. The chicken is super moist inside but crunchy bits of chars outside make 
                them taste heavenly. Grilled chickens are normally served with Naan Rooti (an oven-baked 
                flatbread), mayonnaise, and simple salads. This is an evening snack, mostly available after 
                5.00 pm at the restaurants.</p>

            <h1> <u>Bangladeshi Desserts</u></h1>
                <h2> <u>Misti Doi (Sweet Yogurt)</u></h2>
            <p>Sweet Yogurt is a traditional Bengali dessert item that is locally known as Mishti Doi.
                 It is a healthy low-fat dessert. No Bengali occasion is complete without Sweet Yogurt
                  and Sweets. It is not your regular yogurt. Also, it is not at all runny as curd. 
                  It is thick, dense, and more like creamy cheesecake. Misti Doi is made with milk and sugar 
                  or jaggery. It differs from plain yogurt because of the technique of preparation. 
                  It is prepared by boiling milk until it is slightly thickened, sweetening it with sugar or 
                  jaggery, and allowing the milk to ferment overnight. Earthenware is always used as the 
                  container for making Misti Doi because the gradual evaporation of water through its porous 
                  walls not only further thickens the yogurt, but also produces the right temperature for the 
                  growth of the culture.</p>
